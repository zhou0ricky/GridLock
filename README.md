# GridLock
Survive as long as possible as a tiny dot avoiding contact with other enemy dots on the grid for as long as possible. Depending on the mode, earn points by either passing target points or surviving as long as possible. Maps are randomly generated through by randomly generating nodes as well as algorithmically constructing edges to create connections. All movement is along these edges. Powerups spawn randomly on nodes which will help the player deter enemy dots.
